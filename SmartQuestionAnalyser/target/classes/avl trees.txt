3. What is the balance factor in an avl tree and how is it calculated?
4. How would you implement an avl tree from scratch?
5. What is the time complexity of search, insert, and delete operations in an avl tree?
6. Compare avl trees with red-black trees in terms of performance and use cases.
7. Describe the process of inserting a node into an avl tree with appropriate rotations.
8. How would you delete a node from an avl tree while maintaining balance?
9. What is the maximum possible height of an avl tree with n nodes?
10. In what scenarios would you prefer using an avl tree over other balanced tree structures?
