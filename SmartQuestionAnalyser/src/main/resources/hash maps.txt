2. How would you implement a hash map that supports insertion, deletion, and lookup operations?
3. Explain how you would handle collisions in a hash map implementation.
4. What is the time complexity for key operations (get, put, remove) in a hash map?
5. How would you implement a thread-safe hash map?
6. Describe how to implement a custom hash function for user-defined objects used as keys in a hash map.
